Medico is a specialized healthcare solution designed to enhance medical decision-making by providing guided medicine recommendations and structured blood bank assistance. Leveraging machine learning, it analyzes significant symptoms to suggest appropriate treatments, focusing primarily on major health concerns while addressing minor symptoms less frequently. This targeted approach ensures that users receive reliable guidance for critical conditions, making healthcare more accessible, especially in areas with limited medical expertise. Alongside medicine recommendations, Medico offers a blood bank assistance feature, enabling users to access essential blood supply information through an organized directory. While not dynamically updated, this system helps users locate potential donors and nearby blood banks, improving access to critical medical resources. By integrating intelligent symptom analysis with essential healthcare support, Medico bridges gaps in the medical system, empowering users with informed treatment options and resource accessibility for improved healthcare outcomes.


Will be adding the whole project by the withing Aug 2025 for better deployment and ease of use.
